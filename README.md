#  Resume Scanner using NLP

This project uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** to help you compare your resume with a job description and estimate how well it matches. It computes a **Resume Match Score (%)** using **TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity**.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Upload your Resume** – PDF or DOCX format  
2. **Upload or enter a Job Description** – Paste or upload a JD as per the company or role you're targeting  
3. *(Optional)* Add your own **Resume Text** – If you want to refine what text from your resume is scanned  
4. Hit **Run** and see your **Match Score (%)**!

## 🎯 Important Notes

- 📝 **Upload your own Job Description** – The better it reflects the role, the more accurate the match  
- 📄 **Upload your own Resume** – Only your resume will be compared to the JD  
- ✏️ *Resume Text is Optional* – You can skip it, but adding a cleaner version might help  
- 📈 **Match Score depends mostly on the Job Description** – The more aligned your resume is to the JD, the higher the score
